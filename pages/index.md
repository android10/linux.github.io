# Linux Docs

Welcome! I would like begin with this **inspirational quote**:

{% include alert.html type="primary" title="If someone is in need, lend them a helping hand. Do not wait for a thank you." %}

Story telling about profesional and personal experiences is something very important to me, not only for learning purpose but also to **avoid others to hit their head against a brick wall**, and thus **avoiding the mistakes I have made in my life and career**.

```
