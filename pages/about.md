# About me

**It is always tough to describe yourself, isn’t it?** Anyway, I consider myself a nerdy geek let’s say, and a strong believer of sharing in all senses. That is why this [Docs Website](/){:target="_blank"} and [My Personal Website](https://fernandocejas.com){:target="_blank"} exist actually. [Open Source for the win!](https://github.com/android10){:target="_blank"}

Currently I am working as a **Head of Engineering** (previously **Director of Mobile**). This has been a role switch in the last few years, getting into a more strategic position by helping companies and teams to develop themselves, to be productive and reach out their goals.

In the last 15 years I worked as **Core Engineer** and **Tech Lead** mainly focused on Mobile Development but with a **full-stack** mindset as well. I also had the opportunity to be **Engineer Manager** since I love solving people’s problems and keeping teams motivated without losing entirely the technical side of things.

Part of my career includes a **Developer Advocate** (Developer Relations) position, which led me to speak at conferences and spread and share knowledge through open source, communities and [blog posts](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/){:target="_blank"}. 

Previously I started as a **developer** and later converted to an **agile coach**. I created a bunch of **start-ups** too which gave me a lot of lessons learned that I'm sharing here. 

**Being social and helping in any way I can, is one the things I like and enjoy the most!**. You can find me here:

I think that summarizes a bit what I have done so far. **Time flies by!**
